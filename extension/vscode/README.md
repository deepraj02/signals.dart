| `sig`    | A Signal Object                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `asig`   | An async Signal Object                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `comp`   | The computed function lets you combine the values of multiple signals into a new signal that can be reacted to, or even used by additional computeds. When the signals accessed from within a computed callback change, the computed callback is re-executed and its new return value becomes the computed signalâ€™s value. |
| `ascomp` | Async Computed is syntax sugar around [FutureSignal].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `csk`    | Change stack is a way to track the signal values overtime and undo or redo values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
